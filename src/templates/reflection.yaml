  Please review your previous answer carefully.
  1. Did you strictly follow the definition of "Urban Renewal"? (Must target EXISTING built-up areas, not new development)
  2. Did you correctly identify the spatial level?
  
  If your previous answer was correct, output it again exactly.
  If it was wrong, correct it.
  
  Output ONLY the final 4-field TAB-separated line. No extra text.
