# Reflection Strategy Prompts (Enhanced V4 - New Hierarchy)
reflection_critique: |
  Please review your previous answer carefully against the strict definitions.
  
  1. **Urban Renewal Check**: 
     - Did you correctly distinguish between **1** (Core Object), **待确定** (Context/Method only), and **0** (Unrelated)? 
     - Remember: "New town development" is 0. "General urbanization" is 0. "Method applied to renewal" is 待确定.
  
  2. **Spatial Study Check**: Is the place mentioned the ACTUAL SUBJECT of research (data source/case study)? If it's just background context, Spatial Study must be 0.
  
  3. **Spatial Level Check**: Did you pick strictly from the 9-level hierarchy?
     - Global
     - Multi-country/Region
     - Country/Region
     - Multi-province/State
     - Province/State
     - Urban Agglomeration
     - Single City
     - Multi-neighborhood/Block
     - Single Neighborhood/Block
