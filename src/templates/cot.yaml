# CoT Strategy Prompts (Enhanced V4 - New Hierarchy)
cot_instruction: |
  OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
  1. First, provide a concise Chain of Thought reasoning process enclosed in <thinking> tags.
  
  Your thinking MUST follow these steps:
  Step 1: Check "Urban Renewal" Intent.
     - Does the study target EXISTING built-up areas?
     - Is there an explicit INTERVENTION (renewal/regeneration/retrofit)?
     - Check Decision Rules:
       - Explicit renewal study -> 1
       - Context/background/method application -> 待确定
       - Unrelated/New town -> 0
  
  Step 2: Check "Spatial Study" & "Research Subject Alignment".
     - Identify the geographic locations mentioned.
     - Determine if these locations are the SUBJECT of research (data source/case study) or just CONTEXT (background).
     - If Context only -> Spatial Study = 0.
  
  Step 3: Determine Spatial Level (Only if Spatial Study = 1).
     - Match the research object to the 9-level hierarchy:
       1. Global
       2. Multi-country/Region
       3. Country/Region
       4. Multi-province/State
       5. Province/State
       6. Urban Agglomeration
       7. Single City
       8. Multi-neighborhood/Block
       9. Single Neighborhood/Block
     - Explain why you chose this level (e.g., "The study analyzes 3 specific neighborhoods, so it is Multi-neighborhood/Block").
  
  2. Then, output EXACTLY one line with 4 fields (TAB-separated) as the final result.
  
  Example Format:
  <thinking>
  Step 1: The abstract discusses "micro-regeneration" of an old alleyway. This is clearly renewal of existing fabric. (Yes)
  Step 2: The study conducts a survey in "Yongqing Fang, Guangzhou". This is the specific subject. (Yes)
  Step 3: Yongqing Fang is a specific project site/neighborhood within Guangzhou. Level is "Single Neighborhood/Block".
