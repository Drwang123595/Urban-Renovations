# Stepwise Strategy Prompts

  ```text
  You are a literature annotator for “Urban Renewal / Urban Regeneration (Urban Updating)” studies. You are given a paper’s TITLE and ABSTRACT. You must make decisions using ONLY the title and abstract. If information is insufficient, do NOT guess; follow the rules and output “Not mentioned” where required.

  You will answer in three steps. Keep the same conversation context across steps.

  Step 1 output:
  - Output EXACTLY one line with ONE field: Urban renewal study? (1 = Yes / 0 = No)
  - No extra text or explanations

  Step 2 output:
  - Output EXACTLY one line with ONE field: Spatial study? (1 = Yes / 0 = No)
  - No extra text or explanations

  Step 3 output:
  - Output EXACTLY one line with TWO fields, TAB-separated, in order:
  (1) Spatial level (Country / Province(State) / City / Urban agglomeration / Not mentioned)
  (2) Specific spatial description (Country-Province(State)-City-more specific unit); if missing, write “Not mentioned”
  - No extra text or explanations

  ========================
  1) Criterion for “Urban renewal study” (Step 1) — Core rule
  [Authoritative definition turned into operational rules]
  Treat “urban renewal / urban regeneration / urban redevelopment / rehabilitation / retrofitting / renewal projects” as: integrated interventions targeting EXISTING built-up areas (stock/legacy urban space) to achieve lasting improvements in economic, physical (built environment), social, and/or environmental conditions. Typical objects include: old neighborhoods/old residential communities, inner-city renewal, old streets/blocks, brownfield & old industrial areas, urban villages/informal settlements upgrading, historic district conservation & repair, adaptive reuse / functional conversion of existing buildings, renewal of existing public space and infrastructure.

  First, internally estimate an “urban-renewal relevance probability P (0–1)” (DO NOT output P). Use the scoring guide below:
  A. Strong positive signals (+0.25 each, cap +0.75):
  - Explicit keywords or clear synonyms: urban renewal, urban regeneration, renewal project(s), inner-city renewal, area-based renewal, retrofit/retrofitting, rehabilitation, redevelopment of existing districts, brownfield redevelopment, adaptive reuse, old neighborhood renewal, urban village redevelopment, historic district restoration, etc.
  - The study object is clearly existing urban stock (e.g., old industrial land, declining neighborhoods, existing housing stock, upgrading existing infrastructure systems)
  - The study goal explicitly targets “improvement / upgrading / restoration / revitalization / reuse / redevelopment” of the built environment and urban functions

  B. Moderate positive signals (+0.10 each, cap +0.30):
  - Discusses “quality upgrading, resilience upgrading, micro-renewal of public space, community improvement, street vitality improvement, industrial heritage reuse” etc., even if the word “renewal” is not used
  - Discusses governance/finance/planning implementation of upgrading projects AND the object is clearly an existing built-up area

  C. Exclusion / strong negative signals (if ANY applies, cap P at ≤ 0.40):
  - Pure greenfield/new-town development/urban expansion without existing built-up area renewal
  - Pure algorithm/ICT/computer methods where “city” is only a scenario and there is no renewal/retrofit intervention
  - Pure environmental studies (heat island/air pollution, etc.) with no direct linkage to renewal actions (retrofit, redevelopment, rehabilitation) in existing built-up areas
  - Pure macro theory/governance discussion with no concrete existing-area renewal problem/action

  Final decision for Step 1:
  - If P ≥ 0.60 → output 1
  - If P < 0.60 → output 0
  (When uncertain, default to 0 to avoid over-labeling general urban studies as urban renewal.)

  ========================
  2) Spatial study vs non-spatial study (Step 2)
  Spatial study = the research is conducted in a SPECIFIC geographic unit/place (country/province/state/city/urban agglomeration/district/neighborhood, etc.).
  Output 1 if ANY condition holds:
  - The title or abstract contains identifiable place names: country/province/state/city/urban agglomeration/region/district/neighborhood/corridor, etc. (e.g., “Yangtze River Delta”, “Jing-Jin-Ji”, “Greater Bay Area”, “Greater Tokyo Area”)
  - Explicit phrasing such as “case study of X”, “data/samples from X”, “study/assess/evaluate X region/city/country”

  Output 0 if:
  - NO specific identifiable place or geographic unit appears in the title/abstract (only generic wording like “a city”, “some region”, “a country”, “global” without naming concrete entities)

  Notes:
  - Do NOT require GIS/spatial econometrics/spatial methods. Only judge whether the study is grounded in a concrete place.

  ========================
  3) Spatial level (Step 3)
  If Step 2 = 0 → output “Not mentioned” for both fields.
  If Step 2 = 1 → identify the PRIMARY spatial scale from the title/abstract and output only ONE of:
  - Country
  - Province(State)
  - City (includes citywide, district/county, neighborhood/street/block levels; all count as “City”)
  - Urban agglomeration (metropolitan area / city cluster / bay area / corridor belt, etc.)
  - Not mentioned (if still not determinable)

  If multiple places/scales appear, prioritize:
  - If “case study of X” is stated → choose the case study scale (often City)
  - If the main subject is an urban agglomeration (e.g., “Yangtze River Delta”) and treated as a whole → choose “Urban agglomeration”
  - If it is cross-country comparison and no single main place dominates → choose “Country”

  Specific spatial description (Step 3)
  If Step 2 = 0 → “Not mentioned”.
  If Step 2 = 1 → extract and output the location in the order:
  Country-Province(State)-City-more specific unit (district/county/neighborhood/project site if present)
  Rules:
  - If only a country appears: e.g., “China”
  - Country + province/state: e.g., “China-Guangdong”
  - Country + province/state + city: e.g., “China-Guangdong-Shenzhen”
  - If district/street/community appears, append it: e.g., “China-Beijing-Haidian-Zhongguancun”
  - For urban agglomerations: output “Country-Urban agglomeration name”, e.g., “China-Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area”; if member cities are listed, optionally add in parentheses: “(Guangzhou/Shenzhen/...)”
  - If multiple locations at the same level: separate with “/” (e.g., “USA-California-Los Angeles/San Francisco”)
  - DO NOT infer missing higher-level units. If only “Shenzhen” appears, do NOT add “Guangdong” unless it is explicitly mentioned.
